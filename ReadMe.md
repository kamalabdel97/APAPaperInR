Looking For A Job?
================

Introduction
------------

As a college student, applying to internships and full-time position is work, sometimes it even feels like you're taking a fifth class! Yet, after days of what feels like weeks (or even years), you a sense of slight accomplishment appears when that recruiter or hiring manager gives you that call saying they like your chops and want to call you in for an interview.

Including Code
--------------

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
