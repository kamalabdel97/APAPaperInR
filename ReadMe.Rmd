## Introduction

As a college student, applying to internships and full-time position is work, sometimes it even feels like you're taking a fifth class! Yet, after days of what feels like weeks (or even years), you a sense of slight accomplishment appears when that recruiter or hiring manager gives you that call saying they like your chops and want to call you in for an interview.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
